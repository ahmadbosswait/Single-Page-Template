# Single-Page-Template
### Portfolio template, designed specifically for single page website

Pillow shop is one of my favorite projects. Basically, it is informative website that show off all information related to the products in one page. It is also considered as a prototype design page that you can explore all functions of a website in a single page.
It is absolute responsive that compatible with different devises, ranging from desktop, tablets to mobile phones etc.
In this app, I use various technologies such as HTML5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, Google APIâ€™s and JavaScript.
